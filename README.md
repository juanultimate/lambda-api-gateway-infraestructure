# AWS lambda function infrastructure
This project provides the required AWS resources to deploy an AWS lambda function.

## Prerequisites
- The [Terraform CLI (1.0.1+)](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started) installed.
- An [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

## How to run
- Provide your AWS credentials
  ```
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
  ```
  _Make sure the user has the enough permissions to create all the resources listed in resources.tf._
- Initialize the configuration. 
  ```
  terraform init
  ```
- Apply the configuration. ðŸš€
  ```
  terraform apply
  ```
  If everything was good, you will get an output similar to this:
  ```
  Apply complete! Resources: 13 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

  Outputs:
    base_url = "https://abcdef0j.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/serverless_lambda_stage"
    function_name = "HelloWorld"
    lambda_bucket_name = "juanultimate-lightly-finally-brave-caribou"

  ```
  
## Troubleshooting
If you get an error like this:
```

It means your user does not have the enough permission to create the required resources.
